Rise of Chi-Fi

1. The ability of China to cultivate high-level intellectuals lags far behind that of developed countries in Europe and America, so studying abroad is the choice of many Chinese students.

2. Chinese students studying abroad bring back advanced technology from Europe and North America. such as the founder of hifiman, Dr. Bian.

3. China's efficient education system has cultivated a large number of inexpensive mid-level intellectuals, which are now significantly oversupplied.

4. 
vstem has cultivated a larae

intellectuals, which are now
significantly oversupplied.
China has a large number of
cheap primary laborers
(currently shrinking, with a
trend of shifting to Southeast
Asia and Africa).
The intense ccompetition of
China's labor force is very seriou!
and the cost of employing people
in companies is very low.
The cost of research and
evelopment of China's mid
ch products is relatively lo
and the efficiency is far
ahead
The production cost of China's
products is slightly higher than
ome developing countries in Asia
Africa, and Latin America, but much
lower than developed countries in
Europe and America.

As a system integration solution.
smartphones belong to mid-tech products
Chinese companies with mid-level R&D
capabilities can complete them, while the
hips and storage etc inside the phone that
rely on high-precision lithography
technology belong to high-tech products, in
which Chinese companies are far behind
Europe and America.
The R&D capabilities of China's
mid-to-high-tech products have
steadily improved significantly
The R&D capabilities of mid-tecl
orocucts can even compete wi
developed countries in Europe
and America
China's industrial production
system is generally very mature
and complete and it is particular
good at controlling costs. Chines

The production lines for high-volume、
onsumer electronics like iPhones are beind
relocated to other countries in Asia. Africa.
and Latin America, while lower-volume HiFi
products like the Philips SHP9500 are opting
to set up factories in China.
Marx's "Labor Value Theory"
China has a huge population
base and an efficient basic
social security system. and
most low-income groups can
afford smartphones. As a
cessity, smartphones have
huge domestic demand.
Chinese smartphone manufacturers
Tepresented by Xiaomi, VlVo, and OPP
have a significant cost advantage ovel
European and American manufacturers such
as Samsung, Sony (Japan), and Google, that
is, they can often provide very high core
&onfiqurations (soc, batteries. ROM. RAM
etc.) at lower prices
Moondrop, being both a leading Chi.
Fi company and a small player in the
consumer electronics market. has
attracted high interest and already
achieved considerable profits.
Moondrop has the ability to try to
use existing OEM solutions and
smartphone core configurations to
do a basic integration, but it cannot
compete with maior Chinese
smartphone manufacturers in
terms of cost efficiency.
HiFi products usually belong to
mid-tech products, which requir
certain R&D capabilities, but th
s not as high
echnica
as that of CPU. GPU chips
R&D of mid-tech products in
China has a very significant
advantage in the global market
The value of a product
ssentially depends on the
abor humans put into creating
it. The labor of Americans is
calculated in USD, while the
labor of chinese is
calculated in RMB.
Companies represented by giants in
the consumer electronics field such
as Apple and Asus, and HiFi
ufacturers such as AKG, ch
to deploy factories in China and
open contract factories in China t
reduce production costs
Emerging HiFi companies "born and raised*in
/China have quickly gained a foothold in the
market with sianificantly lower R&D and
production costs than developed countries in
Europe and America. and generally use price
as a strategic advantage, carrying the label o
"high cost performance"
The "cost effective" label of chi-Fi
manufacturers was deeply rooted at the
beginnina of development. and it is
difficult to enter the eyes of Hi-End
enthusiasts, which made their attemp
of entering to the high-end market is
very difficult.
The purchasing power ofan
merican buying an Audeze
LCD5 ($4500) is only
enough for a Chinese to bu)
an LCD2 (¥6119).
Chi-Fi manufacturers are aradually squeezin
the livina space of traditional European ano
American HiFi manufacturers, eroding the
mid-to-low-end market, making European
and American HiFi manufacturers generally
tend to develop towards the hiah-end marke
and give up the sinking market

Moondrop has made a HiFi phone worth
playing for European and American
audiophiles, but the overall cost
performance is still much lower than that
of China domestic phones with similiar
confiquration + Chinese usb-aux dongles
Chi-Fi entry-level products often
have a higher cost efficiency, while
the Hi-End market is still
dominated by European and
American HiFi brands,.
