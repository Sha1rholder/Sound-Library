# Preface

**Theoretically**, planar diaphragm units are a near-perfect design. There are two common types: electrostatic units driven by electrostatic attraction and planar magnetic units driven by electromagnetic force.

Stax X9000, the new flagship model released a few years ago.

Audeze MM-500, a new planar magnetic headphone aimed at the professional monitoring market.

These products can **accommodate larger diaphragms within the same enclosure size, significantly address issues like break-up and mechanical filtering**, and achieve lower distortion and higher sensitivity through balanced push-pull driving on both sides. If applied to headphones, it becomes even more advantageous as the figure-8 polar pattern of planar/electrostatic speakers is no longer an issue (for planar/electrostatic speakers, placement is critical, with common brands including QUAD, MartinLogan, and Magnepan. You can look up "figure-8 polar pattern" for more details).

Pictured: Magnepan planar speakers, which should not be placed against walls.

It sounds wonderful, doesn't it? Compared to the many flaws of dynamic drivers, **aren't you tempted to immediately switch to planar magnetic headphones to experience true HiFi?**

Hold on, **pay attention to the first word—"theoretically"**. It only matters if we can mass-produce products with these superior characteristics.

**The world's first mass-produced planar magnetic headphones appeared in the 1970s, but their real rise began around 2009-2010**. Nearly 40 years passed in between. Have you ever wondered why?

There were also OEM versions, like the NAD RP18.

Here's a simple and easy-to-understand reason—**check when the commercial mass application of NdFeB magnets (neodymium magnets) began**.

Wait a minute, wasn't the Fostex T50 mass-produced and launched in 1974? Isn't it considered an introductory model for many planar headphone manufacturers? Isn't Fostex planar headphone modification popular abroad? Do we really need to use neodymium magnets?

![7](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/7.jpg>)  
The most common modification uses the T50RP, such as replacing the wooden chamber.

![8](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/8.jpg>)  
Or modifying the damping material inside the chamber.

![9](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/9.jpg>)  
And the filtering components on the front of the unit, among others.

Of course, there are other options. The budget model HE400 hasn't used neodymium magnets even to this day. What are the alternatives? AlNiCo (aluminum-nickel-cobalt) magnets or SmCo (samarium-cobalt) magnets, but neither are the best choices today.

AlNiCo magnets have a low maximum energy product (BHmax), resulting in low sensitivity and poor sound detail in planar headphones. SmCo magnets are expensive, and even high-performance models like 35E are not as strong as N55 neodymium magnets. Their advantage lies in high-temperature applications, which is irrelevant for headphones (SmCo magnets have lower magnetic resistance, so some high-end MC cartridges still use them. Interested parties can check the websites of magnet manufacturers like ARNOLD).

I know **this material science stuff is boring. As someone who just listens to music and plays games, do I need to care about this?**

For those with unlimited budgets who go straight for the summit-fi, no worry. Flagship models from renowned manufacturers are always reliable. I fully support audiophiles going all-in. Caldera, LCD-5, SUS, 1266—why not get one? It's just a few thousand dollars, right?

![10](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/10.jpg>)  
ZMF Caldera Open. A closed version was recently released.

![11](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/11.jpg>)  
Abyss 1266, nothing much to say. The biggest issue is comfort, but the sound is just so so in my opinion.

Haha, criticize me later. I know it's full of bullshit for most people. Most people buy an HE400, find it hard to drive, with poor detail and dynamics, then seek advice and try to tweak the source and amplifier. This is the norm.

![12](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/12.jpg>)  
HE400se, I have one, but I won't comment on the sound.

If you've understood the differences in magnets I've mentioned, you'll realize that this is the result of manufacturers cutting corners and reducing costs. Tweaking the amplifier won't solve the fundamental problem. Even if your ears can tolerate it, aren't you worried about the diaphragm overheating and deforming? If you have the skills, you can try replacing the magnets (plenty of videos have shown how to do this). If not, it's better to save up for the next model. **The fact is from a material cost and manufacturing process perspective, planar magnetic headphones are inherently "luxury" products.**

**Ideals are beautiful. Reality is harsh.**

The design of planar diaphragms is a "premature birth." The design is excellent, but the supply chain hasn't kept up. Now the supply chain is better, but what about the cost?

The reason I'm writing this article is simple: **some audiophiles have a blind admiration and faith in a certain type of product, which may stem from selective information provided by manufacturers and other audiophiles, leading to the perceived superiority of certain products. It's fine to have a some snake oil, but something they don't tell you are important too. Moreover, technical advantage is not sufficient condition for a good product. Some fancy "terms" are not new inventions though.**

When we talk about HiFi, we first need to understand what these things are, their characteristics, and what type of music they are suitable for, to maximize the advantages and features of electroacoustic products and achieve high-quality music reproduction and enjoyment.

# 1. What is Planar Headphone?

There are two types of planar diaphragm headphones in production: electrostatic headphones and planar magnetic headphones. The former is driven by electrostatic attraction, while the latter is driven by electromagnetic force.

They all feature **large planar diaphragms**, which is beneficial for headphones and speakers. **As said, "the bigger, the better." Good bass extension and dynamics depend on large diaphragms.** This is a physical law; even aliens can not make 3-inch speakers which is able to achieve 20Hz -3dB bass.

Of course, headphones with small dynamic drivers (usually 30-45mm in diameter) on the market also claim good frequency response. Since headphones couple with the human ear much better than speakers, there is less bass leakage. Therefore, dynamic headphones do not lack bass. Moreover. What's more, some manufacturers play tricks with frequency response labeling, such as using -10dB as the test condition. In that case, they could write the bass extension down to infrasound.

![13](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/13.jpg>)  
The unit of ZMF Atrium Closed. It has a very large bio-diaphragm as a dynamic, but still smaller than Caldera's.

Additionally, **planar diaphragm units can achieve large-area and relatively uniform force-driven operation, effectively solving issues like break-up, mechanical filtering, delay, and local resonances**. Especially break-up, which causes a lot of harmonic distortion (break-up simply means the diaphragm's mechanical properties do not match the ideal model, causing local deformation and dividing into multiple sectors vibrating in different ways. There is a lot of research on this; search the above terms for more information).

Among these two types of planar diaphragm headphones, there isn't much to say about electrostatic headphones.

Although electrostatics are always at the top of the headphone hierarchy of disdain, they are not widely used or discussed. The reasons are simple, **high cost, fragile, needing for dedicated amplifiers**. These issues deter many people from giving to try to electrostatics. Those who aren't deterred often find the bass and strange soundstage of entry-level Stax electrostatic headphones unsatisfactory. For better, more enjoyable electrostatic headphones that can compete with other high-end headphones, sorry, you need to start with the 009, which costs over 10,000 RMB, and even then, the bass performance is just okay (the soundstage issue is resolved though). The X9000 is excellent in all aspects, but it costs over 30,000 RMB.

![14](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/14.jpg>)  
Stax has many headphone models, but in terms of sound quality, start with the round diaphragm series, with the cheapest being the 007.

![15](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/15.jpg>)  
The legend of the OMEGA is even more valuable. The 009 is the most affordable second-hand option. For the ultimate experience, go for the X9000.

A 30,000 RMB headphone that requires a dedicated amplifier is frankly irrelevant to most audiophiles. In subsequent discussions on planar magnetic headphones, I might briefly touch on some common design features. If you want to consult on purchasing advice, here's a practical suggestion: ask yourself if you can afford a budget of at least 20,000 RMB for an electrostatic headphone and a dedicated amplifier, even second-hand. If you can, then we can go to the next steps and usage tips. If not, there's no need to think about electrostatics.

Moreover, **even the so-called "king of headphones," the Sennheiser HE-1, is not invincible**. The diaphragm-to-electrode distance in electrostatic headphones is very small (less than 1mm). For example, the new Stax SR-X1 has a diaphragm-to-electrode distance of only 0.5mm, limiting the diaphragm's movement and preventing it from producing powerful, bold low frequencies. This is an inherent limitation of electrostatic headphones (which is also the reason why third-party electrostatic amplifiers like the BHSE sometimes damage electrostatic headphones. If the diaphragm's amplitude is too large, it hits the electrode, unrelated to the polarization voltage. The bias is always 580V).

![16](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/16.jpg>)  
If you're tempted by Sennheiser, get an HE60. It's not too expensive, but the amplifier is proprietary.

# 2. Things You Need to Know About Planar Headphones

The mainstream of planar diaphragm headphones is planar magnetic headphones, which are the focus of our discussion.

"Planar Magnetic Headphones" is one of the most commonly used terms for this type of headphone.

This term refers to the **source of the headphone unit's driving force**. Planar magnetic headphones use the entire surface's electromagnetic force to drive the diaphragm (T+A calls their Solitaire P Planar-Magnetostatic Headphones for similiar reason).

![17](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/17.jpg>)  
T+A has deep expertise in planar magnetic headphone units.

Another less common term is "Isodynamic Headphones," originating from Fostex.

This term emphasizes the working characteristics of planar magnetic headphones. How should we understand "iso"? Indicating that the diaphragm is driven by electromagnetic force on both sides simultaneously, these headphones work in a push-pull manner. If you use a BTL balanced amplifier with a dual-magnet planar headphone, congratulations! You've achieved a truly balanced headphone system (single-end magnet planar headphones are not considered isodynamic units).

![18](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/18.jpg>)  
BTL means bridging, using twice the components to achieve three to four times the power (considering power losses).

Historically, **the pioneering planar magnetic headphones already had all the design features of modern high-performance planar headphones**, such as the Fostex T50 released in 1974. While not the earliest mass-produced model, it is undoubtedly the most influential (emphasizing, I'm talking about the T50, not the T50RP, which was released in 2002 and has been updated to MK4. The units differ significantly).

The T50 used round units, dual samarium-cobalt magnets fixed by stator plates, Kapton diaphragm, M-shaped planar coils formed by printing technology, open design with damping materials for tuning, and small round ear cups. Some designs were inherited, while others were improved. Below, I will explain their design features and modern improvements.

## Unit Shape and Ergonomics

Do headphone units have to be round? **No.**

This is a typical stereotype. The AKG K1000 units are rectangular, but they still use a round voice coil. The Scan-Speak D2404/552000 tweeter also breaks the round voice coil impression, changing it to an oval shape. In planar magnetic headphones, the "voice coil" is laid on the diaphragm, so the unit shape is not restricted. It can be round, square, or any other shapes.

Scan-Speak's oval voice coil tweeter, this unit is pricey and not commonly used in finished speakers.

However, **wild and imaginative designs often mean difficulty in manufacturing and various unknown issues**. The T50 adopts a round casing, which, when paired with a round unit, can achieve the maximum diaphragm area and highlight the large diaphragm feature of planar headphones. At the same time, the diaphragm is stretched and fixed on the frame under a certain tension. With repeated vibrations, surface stress will inevitably become uneven, and at this time, round units also have some advantages.

This idea aligns with the understanding of most players and manufacturers, but the problem lies in this "large diaphragm." The larger the diaphragm, the larger the unit and cavity, and then the heavier the headphones, making them more awkward to wear. So, some manufacturers have modified the traditional design, such as HIFIMAN using ear-shaped units, and Dan Clark Audio Stealth and Audeze LCD series using rectangular units.

![32](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/32.jpg>)  
The old design claimed a 106mm unit, but the actual effective diaphragm area is not that large

**Although they are all "non-circular units," their design philosophies are different.**

HIFIMAN is straightforward: the ear-shaped cavity conforms to ergonomics, right? You want the largest diaphragm area, right? Then it's simple, just make the unit ear-shaped as well. Apart from the necessary structural parts, the rest is filled with the diaphragm.

![33](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/33.jpg>)

My HIFIMAN Edition X is under such a design. However, please note that the "effective" diaphragm part isn't that large. The middle part with coils and magnets is driven by electromagnetic force, while the surrounding part without coils or magnets just follows the vibration and is then blocked by the ear pads, causing issues like sound reflection.

Therefore, there is another design, such as the rectangular units from manufacturers like Dan Clark Audio and Audeze. Their thinking can be roughly described as: only the effective vibrating part is considered, excluding the positions of structural parts and the positions blocked by the ear pads, and the remaining places are filled with coils and magnets. So, don't get excited when you see Audeze claiming a 106mm unit (the new models like LCD-5 and MM-500 are 90mm units), thinking it's such a large unit. The actual effective diaphragm shape is not a circle with a diameter of 106mm.

## Stator Plates and Strong Magnets

Many planar headphones have a sandwich structure, with magnets fixed on the structural parts on both sides of the diaphragm, and the diaphragm in the middle. However, structural parts and stator plates are not the same. The stator plate not only fixes the magnets but also directs and constrains the magnetic field. Dynamic driver units also have a similar component called the "pole piece."

Theoretically, using stator plates can increase the magnetic field strength by about 0.1T, but the cost is the diffraction problem when sound waves pass through the stator plate (affecting treble). Especially after the widespread application of neodymium magnets, this bit of magnetic field strength is not much needed and may not be worth the effort. Most new designs use non-magnetic materials, with engineering plastics being a good and common choice. ZMF Caldera is more "modern," choosing carbon fiber plates as the front panel of the unit.

![34](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/34.jpg>)  
HIFIMAN's early product designs were relatively "traditional."

![35](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/35.jpg>)

Non-magnetic structural parts mean losing the effect of the stator plate's magnetic field constraint. Then how to make the magnetic field more concentrated and efficient? Most manufacturers work on the size, layout density, and polarity arrangement of the magnets. For example, Audeze's Flux Magnetic technology refers to changing the polarity direction of the magnets. New models like the LCD-5 further use spliced magnets (Meze's advertised "magnetic field shielding," "magnetic ear pads," and "sensitivity improvement" are achieved through magnetic stator plates, rumored to have patents. I'm curious how they got approved, maybe it's a utility model or something?).

Unit of Meze Elite

The choice of magnets is very consistent (except for cheap ones), with neodymium magnets (NdFeB Magnets) being used across the board. They are cost-controllable, shape-controllable (powder sintering), and high-performance strong magnets that can be mass-customized. Their appearance is easily recognizable because neodymium magnets are prone to rust due to moisture in the air, so surface treatment is necessary. The common shiny silver appearance is the result of nickel plating.

Since it is powder sintered, it is not difficult to make into special shapes

When discussing unit panels and magnets, there is a "mystical" term that I believe every audiophile is familiar with, **stealth magnets**. It means reducing the diffraction and impact of the magnets/panel on the sound. HIFIMAN often boasts about this, but any manufacturer making planar headphones needs to solve this problem. It's just a matter of whether they invent new terms and promote them.

Here's a few examples, such as Audeze's FAZOR sound filter, ZMF Caldera's trapezoidal magnets, and Moondrop Venus's irregular magnets, all having similar effects but different handling methods. They can either choose irregular magnets or design a separate waveguide component. The basic requirement is basicly if the sound-transmitting area exceeds one-third, the impact of the magnets/panel should be relatively controllable. The larger the gap between the magnets, the flatter and more natural treble is, and the sensitivity may be slightly lower. When designing the unit, manufacturers need to comprehensively consider various issues.

Early HIFIMAN headphones without stealth magnets. Some of them used thinner magnets to reduce the impact

## Diaphragm, Coil, and Impedance

The diaphragm of planar headphones is very particular. First of all, it should be light and thin, able to withstand a certain amount of heating (the coil will heat up during operation), have a certain elasticity (to achieve a lower resonant frequency, i.e., f0, to meet bass performance), and the coil must be stably attached.

From these requirements, the Kapton film used in the T50 is obviously outdated. This material is not uncommon; search for high-temperature tape, and that brownish semi-transparent material is Kapton film. Currently, common materials include PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PU (polyurethane), PAR (polyarylate), PEN (polyethylene naphthalate), etc. No need to remember them; simply put, they are various polyester plastics. The films made from them are much lighter and thinner than the Kapton films of the past, but to say they have reached the nanoscale level that HIFIMAN boasts about is a bit far-fetched.

First, let's give a reference—Stax SR-009 electrostatic headphone diaphragm thickness is 0.9μm, i.e., 900nm. You can call it a nano-diaphragm, but "sub-micron" might be more accurate. Then, we need to note, electrostatic headphones have no coils, so the diaphragm of the 009 is just 0.9μm thick. But planar headphones have coils, right? The total thickness is inevitably in the micron range.

![46](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/46.jpg>)  
The diaphragm of electrostatic headphones cannot be directly seen; what you see are the electrode plates and dustproof net

Here we can give a rough reference. Mainstream planar headphones are generally around 2μm, with the thinnest being 0.5μm for the LCD-5 and Metropolis, and slightly thicker at 6μm for the FiiO FT5. HIFIMAN is just playing a word trick; after all, thousands to tens of thousands of nanometers can also be called nanometers, right?

But it must be said that even considering the coil, the thickness of modern planar headphone diaphragms is significantly less than that of dynamic driver units, reaching levels close to electrostatic headphones. A thin diaphragm means it can vibrate quickly, with excellent treble response. This can also be seen from measurements: low distortion, greatly reduced break-up, and good phase consistency. This is the progress of technology and supply chains, allowing the planar headphone structure to truly show its advantages, leading to the "technological worship of planar headphones."

**I do not oppose technological worship, but sometimes you have to pay more. It's not like using planar units automatically makes it great.**

For example, with cheap and shoddy products like the HE400, do you hear treble detail and layers? It's just piece of mush. Also, "buy new, not old." Don't bother with well-known models from over a decade ago, like the HE6, first-gen Abyss 1266, LCD-2. Please believe in industrial progress. The so-called golden coils and such, using glue to stick gold foil, is just outdated. I heard that Original Voice (a Chinese diy headphone brand) made a gold coil using target sputtering, which is a bit interesting.

Additionally, I recently saw a new play: Sivga P2PRO's unit. Usually, the diaphragm of planar headphones is transparent, but the P2PRO's displayed photos are white and opaque. The official explanation is not very detailed, but it is roughly speculated that a coating was added to the diaphragm. This play is not uncommon in dynamic driver units, but it's the first time I've seen it in planar headphones.

The progress in coil manufacturing processes is remarkable. The T50's process is similar to PCB circuit boards, i.e., "film printing process." It's classic, and there are still DIY players using flexible circuit boards to assemble planar units. But this diaphragm is too thick, and the sound absolutely varies from electrostatic headphones.

The traditional process is roughly like: first combine the plastic diaphragm with the metal conductor, either by sticking metal foil or full-surface electroplating; then use chemical etching or laser engraving to remove the unnecessary parts. I have to criticize the Edition X again. The coil looks like it was chewed by a dog, and the pasted metal foil can fall off. The new models are a bit better, not as bad.

**The popular "nanoscale semiconductor process" actually just uses deep ultraviolet lithography**. It can be summarized as: film printing + high-temperature electroplating. There's no chemical etching or laser engraving step, and it is directly formed in one go. The precision will be much higher, so it can make particularly fine coils, like the ultra-high impedance planar units of Mr. Tang (Tang diy is another Chinese diy headphone brand) which are made this way.

The coil process requires uniform thickness and clean routing, which is highly dependent on the supply chain and industrial technology. However, the coil layout, impedance, and number of turns are not fixed.

The M-shaped routing is a classic design. According to Fostex, compared to spiral routing, it has better control over the diaphragm. The magnetic diagram clearly shows this: magnets are placed side by side, and the magnetic force is stronger in the gap between the two magnets. The coil passes through this gap, forming an M-shaped routing after winding around.

The magnet layout for spiral routing is different. Japanese manufacturers like YAMAHA have insisted on spiral routing from the YH-1 to the current YH-5000SE, though the new product is a deafening artifact, with extremely bright treble. Don't know if this design is responsible for that. Then, there is a hybrid special case: Meze Elite, with both magnets and coils having a partitioned layout.

![49](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/49.jpg>)

On the basis of M-shaped routing, specific coil layouts can be further divided into two factions: coils covering the entire diaphragm and coils arranged only in the effective parts.

Here, new terms are created, such as the design with coils covering the entire diaphragm, which Moondrop calls "FDT Full Drive Technology." The design with coils arranged only in the effective parts is called "Suspended Circuit" by Original Voice. I consider this from another angle: the diaphragm material is various polyester plastics, and the conductor material is metal foil. Their characteristics must be different, right? From this perspective, the design with coils covering the entire diaphragm may have better overall consistency for the diaphragm? The diaphragm of the Abyss 1266 is like this, with metal foil covering even the ineffective parts, possibly considering this aspect.

Impedance is not something to worry about; sensitivity is key. As long as you have a powerful amplifier, impedance levels are not a concern. Unlike dynamic headphones, which have inductive coils, planar magnetic headphones have planar coils that approximate a purely resistive load. Short and thick coils result in low impedance, while long and thin coils result in high impedance.

Low impedance requires the amplifier to deliver high instantaneous current, while high impedance requires higher voltage. Desktop amplifiers can easily handle both, but if you insist on using portable devices, avoid those with too low impedance. Modern portable devices can easily output high voltage but struggle with sustained high current, leading to issues like overheating and current limiting. This should be easy to understand. We will discuss amplifier choices and considerations in detail later, along with specific products.

![51](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/51.jpg>)  
Amplifier output power matters, but understanding it is not just about comparing numbers.

There is no need to worry about coil material either; manufacturers aren't skimping on the cost of metal conductors. Even precious metals can be recycled, which is not news.

Aluminum coils are commonly used because aluminum is lightweight. In dynamic headphones, copper-plated aluminum coils are common. For high conductivity, pure silver or silver alloys are also common. Pure gold has a unique sound but isn't highly conductive. High-end MC cartridges use pure gold coils for this unique sound. However, gold is dense and heavy, which contradicts the lightweight diaphragm requirements of planar headphones.

Van den Hul The Condor, pure gold coils. The use of pure gold in HiFi products is not uncommon; not seeing it doesn't mean it's pseudoscience.

**Manufacturers need to consider multiple factors when choosing coil materials. While cost is a factor, for planar units with low yield rates, "labor is always more expensive than materials." You can cut costs anywhere, but not on the diaphragm.** After all, if the magnets are subpar, it only affects sensitivity, and people can still convince themselves it's fine. A plastic shell with a nice paint job won't cause major issues, but a poor diaphragm means real problems.

# 3. The Origin of Diaphragm Wrinkles and Determining Headphone Lifespan

Early planar headphones didn't have the problem of diaphragm wrinkles. The Kapton film used in the T50, while not lightweight, was sturdy and heat-resistant. Diaphragm wrinkles can be caused by three main factors:

1. The diaphragm itself is deformed.
2. The unit's support structure is deformed.
3. The stress on the diaphragm is uneven.

These causes can be further subdivided. For example, diaphragm deformation might be due to high-power driving causing the coil to heat up and deform the diaphragm. Planar headphones that have been driven aggressively might have this issue. It could also be due to uneven air pressure, compressing the diaphragm and causing wrinkles. This is common in headphones with high air-tightness, like Audeze products with unvented leather ear pads. Quickly and roughly putting on or taking off the headphones, or pressing them from the outside, can cause diaphragm wrinkles, and in severe cases, diaphragm rupture (be careful when replacing third-party ear pads; the higher the air-tightness, the more careful you should be when handling them. The same goes for electrostatic headphones).

![53](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/53.jpg>)  
Audeze diaphragm wrinkle issue is closely related to the ear pads, which are fully leather and unvented.

![54](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/54.jpg>)  
Be careful when putting on and taking off electrostatic headphones to avoid rough handling.

Deformation of the unit's support structure is the manufacturer's fault: poor structural design. The magnets' poles are placed opposite each other, so the front and rear panels fixing the magnets are always under stress. If the frame strength is insufficient or the fixing method is shitty, the support structure will deform, causing the diaphragm frame to deform as well, leading to diaphragm wrinkles. This issue is unsolvable; even replacing the headphones won't help. You'd need to switch to a different manufacturer.

Uneven stress on the diaphragm can be categorized into two types. First, some manufacturers aim for a low f0 to achieve better bass performance. If the diaphragm isn't thin or elastic enough, they can only fix the diaphragm loosely, leading to wrinkles over time. The solution is to get a new pair. The other situation is natural aging of the headphone unit over time, causing uneven stress as the diaphragm ages differently in various parts. This issue manifests differently based on coil layout, sometimes more noticeable, sometimes less so. It's an unsolvable issue, but natural aging-induced wrinkles generally don't have a significant impact.

How to determine the impact of diaphragm wrinkles?  
It's simple. First, check for distortion or buzzing. Second, when putting on or taking off the headphones, listen for the rustling sound of the diaphragm wrinkles, similar to a crinkling plastic bag. If you hear it, prepare for a factory repair. If not, there's no need to worry.

Many people also worry about the relationship between diaphragm wrinkles and headphone lifespan.  
I consulted manufacturers about this, the answer is: don't worry too much. Use sound distortion, buzzing, or rustling as judgment criteria.

Modern polymer diaphragms are durable (electrostatic headphones are most vulnerable to moisture, similar to condenser microphones), but as moving parts, they naturally age with repeated vibrations. This aging is usually uneven. In other words, slight diaphragm wrinkles in planar headphones are acceptable. Dynamic driver units also age, though their aging isn't as visible as diaphragm wrinkles. Burn-in essentially means quickly aging new electroacoustic products to reach a stable state.

Damage can be due to design flaws (contact the manufacturer for after-sales service) or improper use (e.g., overheating due to high power). Some planar headphones indeed have low sensitivity, but this doesn't mean they can handle super high power, nor does aggressive output save a poor-quality headphone. Other common HiFi headphone care tips, like handling gently, not using solvents other than clean water for cleaning, etc., won't be repeated here.

# 4. The Playability of Ear Pads and the Significance of Tweaking

Ear pads are an important tool for tuning planar headphones, and the only tool that users can operate themselves.

I know some friends will mention "cable swapping." For multi-driver hybrid IEMs, I don't oppose cable swapping, but planar headphones are different. As mentioned earlier, planar headphones approximate a purely resistive load and are mostly driven by low-output-impedance amplifiers. In this case, the impact of the capacitive load brought by the headphone cable is limited, far less than the impact and improvement brought by ear pads (some special cables, like JPS aluminum alloy cables, introduce coloration, which is a difference, not an improvement).

Cables can be fun to play with, but after a certain level, it's more about differences than improvements.

**Why tweak ear pads?** This goes back to the design of planar headphones: planar headphones are predominantly open-back designs, and the degree of openness is generally high. Some extreme models, like the Susvara Unveiled, even forgo the dust cover on the rear chamber.

This seems absurd, but makes theoretical sense. **Planar headphones have thin, large diaphragms, and the airflow reflections and disturbances caused by the rear chamber structure affect the sound.** We can refer to the X9000's design, where an important improvement is the tilted angle of the rear structure and protective mesh to reduce such impacts. This is different from the cavity tuning of dynamic headphones (there are planar headphones that use damping tuning, like Dan Clark Audio and ZMF; I'll discuss ZMF Caldera later). But while you can do that to the rear chamber, what about the front? You can't just remove the ear pads and make it like the AKG K1000 ear-hook speakers, can you? That design was proved unsuccessful.

![57](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/57.jpg>)  
![58](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/58.jpg>)

Ear pads are necessary, but thin ear pads with small openings like the T50's won't work. The current mainstream choice is large-opening ear pads with a thick and asymmetrical design for better comfort, support, and air-tightness, with fine-tuning through material combinations and partial perforations. There are many examples of this, not only from original manufacturers but also from third-party manufacturers like ZMF. Let's talk about how I tweak ear pads.

First, what kind of headphones need ear pad replacement?  
For dynamic headphones, replace the ear pads if they collapse or deform (like with the HD600) or if they age and compress (like with the HD800). For the HD660S2, at least replace them with the older version's original pads, as the new ones could get very hot when wearing.

![59](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/59.jpg>)  
![60](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/60.jpg>)

You have no choice; the ear pads can't support the headphones anymore. Not only will they leak air, but the drivers will also be closer to your ears, making the sound wrong. If you ignore it, the sound-damping foam will wear out, and you'll end up replacing both. These headphones have been on the market for a long time, and there are plenty of cheap replacements on Taobao. **Choosing ZMF has two reasons: 1. The synthetic suede material is similar to the original but much more durable; 2. The Visco foam inside ZMF pads has better rebound and support than the original.**

The only thing to note is the lambskin version sounds quite different from the original. If you don't want to change the sound much, choose perforated or non-perforated suede. The sound will be slightly clearer, but the overall style remains consistent.

**For planar headphones, ear pad replacement is for multiple reasons, not just functionality.**

Since planar headphones are generally heavier, the air-tightness, shape, and support of the ear pads are crucial. Poor air-tightness leads to leakage, and once that happens, the bass suffers. I'll show you a graph to illustrate: my own frequency response test of the FT5. **To be clear, this is the result of my testing with leakage; the FT5 itself doesn't have bass issues.** Why did this happen? My test head is a bit large, and the FT5 has a self-adjusting headband, so it always leaks a bit during testing. When it leaks, the bass looks like this. You can check other people's tests for comparison.

![61](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/61.jpg>)  
![62](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/62.jpg>)  
FiiO FT5, the bass attenuation is due to leakage during the test.

Different materials for ear pads also make a difference. Suede, protein leather, lambskin, and cowhide all have different softness levels, affecting how they fit the face. Plus, whether they are perforated or not, it's normal for the same planar headphone to have different bass evaluations (I attached a frequency response graph of ZMF Caldera with leather and suede ear pads. You can see the difference; it sounds even more distinct. I also made a cloud listening comparison).

![63](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/63.jpg>)  
The bass is almost the same, but the mid-high frequencies differ.

Shape and support are a bit abstract. Simply put, **asymmetrical ear pads can improve air-tightness and create a suitable angle between the headphone driver and the ear, reducing adverse effects from ear reflections.**

This might still be hard to understand, right? Why have an angle? Look in the mirror; your ears aren't parallel, right? Many headphones have this design, like the Beyerdynamic T1 and Sennheiser HD800, where the drivers are fixed at an angle. **It's hard to create this angle in planar headphone drivers, but it can be achieved with asymmetrical ear pads.**

![64](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/64.jpg>)  
In this figure, d is the ear pad angle.

Also, the driver should be a certain distance from the ear. Why does the HD800 have a large soundstage? One reason is that the driver isn't close to the ear. Planar drivers close to the ear sound odd, with a narrow soundstage, sharp treble, and weak bass if there's air leakage. I tested this by fitting ZMF Caldera ear pads (perforated suede version) on the Metropolis and Waterfall. It solved many of the common issues (I say that because I'm a classical music enthusiast. Some genres like Mai-K might not be as forgiving).

![65](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/65.jpg>)  
Bottom left is the ZMF pads. They aren't cheap.

With the explanation above, I believe the importance of tweaking ear pads for planar headphones is clear. So, why does a single manufacturer like ZMF offer so many ear pad specifications?

It's simple; everyone's ear angle and size are different, so they need multiple options. If you ask for recommendations, I'd say start with Caldera and Bokeh, one of the two.

These two have the same shape and type, with Bokeh being slightly thinner. They both use a dual-layer filling design: gel at the bottom and slow-rebound foam on top, providing excellent support. The shape is asymmetrical, with the thinnest part at the cheeks and the thickest part at the back, ensuring comfort and air-tightness. These features aren't obvious from photos, but you'll notice when you try them. Priced at over 600 yuan, even Chinese manufacturers have started making knockoffs, so there's no need to doubt their effectiveness.

Other models differ in opening size and height difference between the sides (affecting the angle when worn). The filling material is always Visco foam. Here's a simple summary:
Ear pad thickness difference: Ori > Auteur, Eikon > Caldera, UNI > Bokeh, BE2 > Verite
Internal opening width: Caldera, Bokeh, Auteur, BE2, Verite > UNI > Eikon, Ori

Material-wise, different materials absorb and reflect sound differently. Perforated suede sounds natural, perforated lambskin more modern and vibrant. If you're a centrist, try hybrid materials (Hybrid, suede + lambskin). For convenience, I use Moondrop headphones for ear pad testing. Their choice is simple—Caldera perforated suede, an excellent choice. HIFIMAN users can try perforated lambskin to solve some "mushy old man" issues (sensitivity might change slightly due to improved air-tightness).

![66](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/66.jpg>)  
Don't just focus on cable swapping; the extra ear pads provided by manufacturers aren't just for show.

![67](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%201)/67.jpg>)  
ZMF is more user-friendly; you can choose the ear pads when ordering. Ask the dealer before buying.

# Conclusion

Today's discussion is mostly conceptual, but we need to first understand what planar headphones are and demystify them before we can talk about how to enjoy them.

Although I mentioned some specific models, I didn't describe their sound. In the next article, I'll combine headphones with amplifiers and discuss the requirements for sources and amplifiers from an electroacoustic science perspective, along with pairing with planar headphones, simulated listening, and my subjective evaluations and technical interpretations of some good planar headphones.
