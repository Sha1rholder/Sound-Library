In our previous article, we delved into the principles, technical features, manufacturing processes, and creative terminologies surrounding planar magnetic headphones. Our aim was to simplify these concepts for everyone, making it easier to understand the recent surge in popularity of planar magnetic headphones in the high-end market. After all, we need to know what manufacturers are boasting about, right?

However, headphones alone aren't the whole story. In the HiFi world, you often hear about "building a system" or "how a certain setup sounds." Simply buying a pair of headphones won't cut it; plugging them into a computer might make sound, but it won't produce great sound.

So, how do you achieve great sound? By investing in a robust audio system. I'll address this by discussing how to optimize your planar magnetic headphones from an audio system perspective, and what we commonly refer to as a HiFi playback system: how to pair it and how to make it sing.

Audio systems don't have to be overly complex, and using them doesn't require deep expertise. Just carefully read the manual.

If you lack knowledge, read more books and acquire first-hand knowledge yourself. Having your own judgment is the way to play it right.

# Audio Playback System from the Perspective of Electroacoustic Science

How many parts can an Audio Playback System be divided into?  
A popular answer is — "Two parts: the headphones and everything else."  
Well, that's for ordinary players. According to the classification standards of electroacoustic science, there is more to consider. Accurately speaking, it is three parts — Source, Amplifier, and Sound Transducer.

The Source, also known as the "audio source," functions to extract music content from storage media and convert it into electrical analog audio signals. The key point is conversion, i.e., Digital to Analog Converter (DAC).

Use DAC for listening and ADC for recording, with opposite functions.

Choosing a machine based on the D/A chip is a typical novice understanding.

Common audio sources come in two types: 1. Analog sources that play analog storage media such as vinyl records, open-reel tapes, or compact cassette tapes. 2. Digital sources that play digital files, CD/SACD discs, and other digital storage media.

Vinyl machines with multiple arms look good, but how useful they are is hard to say.

According to a popular saying: analog is superior to digital. This is not wrong but has a premise: analog sources are more expensive and have a higher entry threshold. With a budget of three to five hundred dollars, don't consider vinyl. Although I am also a vinyl user, I never recommend beginners to buy a vinyl turntable. If you really want to have a try, you can refer to my vinyl series of popular science articles. Today's discussion is based on digital sources.

Here's a small question: do products like digital amplifiers and digital speakers (e.g., GENELEC SAM series 8351) that don't require "conversion" still need a source?

Absolutely, where does the digital signal come from? From a USB Audio Bridge (DDC), an Audio Interface (sound card), a CD Transport (CDT), or a Network Audio Streamer.

Therefore, there is a further subdivision — "digital sources and analog sources in digital audio sources."

Analog sources refer to decoders, while digital sources refer to machines that provide digital signals. Different digital sources mean different ways of playing and system composition. For example, USB interfaces and audio interfaces belong to PChifi. If using digital speakers or digital amplifiers, only digital sources are needed (the simplest is the optical or coaxial output of the computer motherboard).

The function of the Amplifier is simple — to amplify analog electrical signals (temporarily not discussing digital amplifiers), but the specific classification is more complicated, such as common preamps, power amps, and integrated amps, which some friends don't understand.

Traditionally, a preamp (before the CD player became popular) refers to a high-gain amplifier that amplifies "weak electrical signals" and is used before a power amplifier (gain can be over 1000 times). The input signal voltage is in the millivolt (mV) range, used with vinyl cartridges, tapes, and other storage media, the most common being the phono stage. In the current context, a preamp accurately refers to a "line stage," with input signal voltages typically ranging from 1-6V RMS, used with digital sources, and the gain is usually low (typically not exceeding 10 times/20dB).

![10](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/10.jpg>)  
PS Audio's pure phono stage, with non-adjustable output level

They only provide voltage gain, without low-impedance load capacity, and cannot directly drive passive speakers and headphones. Since the output level of digital sources is very high (common specifications: single-ended 2V RMS, balanced 4V RMS), a preamp is not necessary for headphone users, unless also using active speakers. However, most headphone amplifiers have preamp outputs, which are sufficient unless pursuing the ultimate.

The function of a power amp is power amplification, providing voltage gain while having high current output capability (i.e., load capacity).

Unlike integrated amplifiers, pure power amps have a very simple function — only responsible for power output. The intuitive difference is that pure power amps cannot adjust the volume, relying on the source or preamp for control. In essence, it is still the "pursuit of the ultimate" theory. Hi-End equipment has no new tricks, just splitting into more parts to sell more expensively, which is understandable (electronic crossover + multiple amplifiers is not a gimmick, it is the ultimate version of passive speaker systems, typically represented by B&W Nautilus, requiring 8 monoblock amps or 4 stereo amps).

My previous setup with Mark Levinson No.326S preamp and Bryston 4B3 power amp

The question arises — what category does a headphone amplifier fall into? It varies, as the past trends differ from the present, and those suitable for dynamic headphones differ from those suitable for planar magnetic headphones.

Most headphone amplifiers can be considered preamps, providing low-gain voltage amplification while having some current output capability, usually between tens to hundreds of milliamperes, with load capacity but not much, not suitable for directly driving speakers. This is easy to understand, as dynamic headphones have always been the market's absolute mainstay, with sensitivity much higher than speakers. Especially high-impedance headphones, under the same output power, the current required by HD600 is significantly less than K701. Even a machine with a minimalist circuit like Graham Slee Solo can be used to some extent.

Bryston BHA-1, a headphone amp made by a HiFi manufacturer based on modern preamp architecture

However, with the popularity of planar magnetic headphones, our requirements for headphone amplifiers have changed. Planar magnetic headphones' sensitivity is not as high as dynamic headphones, and they are all low impedance, which is a "heavy load" in electroacoustic terms. Therefore, planar magnetic headphone users generally pursue high-power, high-current output headphone amplifiers, with a maximum power of several watts. For example, the Burson Soloist Voyager and Aune S17 Pro I use are typical products of the "planar magnetic headphone era."

![13](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/13.jpg>)  
Burson paired with Final, I really like this setup

In rare cases, some low-sensitivity products lead some users to believe in "miracles through brute force," favoring "powerful bricks." In such cases, conventional headphone amplifiers cannot meet the demand, and power amplifiers are needed. A popular choice is small power pure Class A integrated amplifiers, such as Accuphase E-650 and LUXMAN L-590AXII, with rated output power of 30W at 8 ohms.

Cayin HA-300 first generation, can connect to headphones and serve as a small power integrated amplifier

My evaluation of this is — violent output cannot save antiques and trash. Brute force does not always create miracles. Either the ears or the headphones will give out first. Overheating the planar headphone coil may cause diaphragm wrinkling and deformation. If it happens within the warranty period, you can argue with the manufacturer. Once out of warranty, don't mess around. The most valuable part of a headphone is the driver unit.

![15](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/15.jpg>)  
For new planar magnetic headphones, especially high-sensitivity models, don't tinker with them using old methods; it's unnecessary.

Sound Transducer is a rare term, a conceptual classification that corresponds to headphones and speakers in audio playback systems.

![16](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/16.jpg>)  
Headphone drivers are transducers. Final's design is quite peculiar, with a large dynamic and a balanced armature driver.

The concept is not difficult to understand. A transducer converts one form of energy into another, converting analog electrical signals into sound waves audible to the human ear (microphones and vinyl cartridges are also electroacoustic transducers). If you want to understand the technical structure of headphones and speakers, look up some professional literature. Sometimes this term is useful, so I won't elaborate further.

# "Front End" Equipment in Players' Terms

Professional terminology is the most accurate but often incomprehensible to most ordinary players. After clarifying the concept of audio playback systems from the perspective of electroacoustic science, let's look at the popular answer — "the front end and the headphones."

At this point, we can say — "Front end" is a general term that includes different forms, structures, and functions, a combination of audio sources and amplifiers.

It can be portable devices like USB dongles, portable DAC+amp, portable digital audio players (DAP), or desktop systems with integrated machines or multi-piece combinations.

This is a vast topic, but thanks to my years of tinkering, I've discussed many issues individually. Now, I need to integrate them in order from simple to complex, supplementing areas not previously covered, introducing personal experiences, and providing practical guidance.

## Portable Devices

Portable devices are currently the mainstay of the HiFi market for no other reason than their relatively low price, compact size, portability, and ease of use. With technological advancements, high-performance, low-power, and miniaturized solutions are becoming increasingly popular.

Typical examples are various new USB dongles, such as DUNU DTC800, FiiO KA13, ONIX Alpha, and Shanling H0 (sorted by initial letter). They use the CS43131/43198+SGM8262-2 solution, which is quite powerful. The finished product can have a maximum rated power of 690mW at 32 ohms (146.84mA output current), and the smaller ones have 450mW. The actual transaction price is no more than $100 (even with a protective case).

![17](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/17.jpg>)  
Products like USB dongles are updated very quickly and are highly competitive.

![18](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/18.jpg>)  
Details will be discussed after detailed testing.

This is quite impressive. To know, this level (450-690mW) of output power is something many larger portable players with built-in batteries cannot achieve. Although we cannot solely rely on output power, for planar magnetic headphones that are inherently "power-hungry," we must consider whether the output power is sufficient.

**How do manufacturers achieve this? Is it overstated?**  
Whether it is overstated, I will test and show you once the machines are in hand. How it is achieved can be explained now — thanks to the new operational amplifier from SGMICRO (released in 2023). Comparing the datasheets of SGM8262-2 and OPA1622 (the original version) and RT6863 (the second version), you will see that SGM8262-2 has a peak output current of 310mA, and can reach 200mA even with low voltage supply. (The following article introduces other USB dongles' test results and technical science. Why do manufacturers insist on output power? Because it is the only area where significant improvements can still be made.)

**So, can the technologically advanced USB dongles be paired with planar magnetic headphones?**  
Unfortunately, although there has been progress, it is not enough. They can be used but are not ideal. The "miniaturization and low power consumption" characteristics often mean "simplified" designs. Portable devices must make some compromises to be "portable." Sound quality, size, power consumption, and cost — pick one. No compromise? Sure, but the result is a "portable brick." What is a "portable brick"? Isn't it just a small desktop device with a built-in battery? (For reviews of portable DAC/amps, you can check out the following three articles.)

![19](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/19.jpg>)  
Put them together for a photo, and you'll immediately understand what "portable brick" means.

[_Why I Need a Portable Android Player — My Personal Feelings on FiiO FIIO M23_](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv33850352)

Why do I keep emphasizing "performance" and "limitations of portable devices"? I just want to listen to good music simply; is it necessary to be so complicated?  
My answer is — for in-ear monitor users, no. For most dynamic headphone users, it's meaningful but not essential. For planar magnetic headphone users, it's very necessary.

Think about it, what are the typical features of planar magnetic headphones? 1. Heavy, with a minimum weight of 400g; 2. Non-isolating, mostly highly open designs; 3. Low impedance + relatively low sensitivity.

Heavy and non-isolating, how do you listen outside? Even if you find a well-isolated closed-back planar headphone, it's still heavy, often even heavier. The low distortion characteristic of the unit sounds good, with a high upper limit, but the premise is — you need to reach that upper limit. This is not just a matter of driving power; the quality of the recording files and hardware equipment must also be up to par, right? Sorry, generally excellent audio hardware is large, power-hungry, and structurally complex equipment.

![20](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/20.jpg>)  
Count how many more things there are, and this is without the USB interface pure DAC.

## Desktop Devices

At this point, my view is already clear — I recommend planar magnetic headphone users to choose desktop devices, but desktop devices come in many forms. Different playing styles have different setups. How to choose? My answer is — act according to your needs and budget. I'll explain "what it is," and you decide "how to do it."

Common desktop devices can be divided into two types:

1. All-in-one machines with rich features, high integration, solving all needs with one machine. These include compact machines (like Aune X1s GT) and large all-in-one machines focusing on performance (like FiiO K19, TOPPING DX9).
2. High-performance but single-function machines that require multiple pieces to be used together, known as "separate systems" among players. A simple setup starts with three pieces — transport + DAC + headphone amp, offering high flexibility, diverse styles, and personalized adjustments.

You can choose either style, but both have a common feature — they don't care much about size and power consumption. Since these are not portable, size doesn't matter much, and as long as the 220V power supply doesn't trip, power consumption is not an issue. With this premise, manufacturers can let loose. The benefits are obvious: comprehensive interfaces, ample power performance, and various features can be added. The appearance can also be made "exotic." The only small problem is — the price has no upper limit; spending thousands just for listening is common.

![21](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/21.jpg>)  
Separate systems are the most fun. With a sufficient budget, you can fully unleash your imagination.

Well, this is actually a wrong "stereotype." Never forget one sentence — technology is advancing. Over 20 years ago, a 24bit/192kHz DAC was an unattainable Hi-End symbol, but now it's everywhere, right? What, technology advanced without you? Or is it that apart from Hi-End equipment, nothing else is listenable?

# Characteristics and Selection of Desktop Systems

How to choose a desktop system? This question can be rephrased — what is the most suitable digital source for your usage scenario?

For example — suppose your usage scenario is "listening to music while sitting in front of the computer." In this case, PChifi is the only best choice. Think about it, the advantage of network streaming is remote control, but if you're sitting in front of the computer, that advantage is gone, right? CDs and CD players take up space, and you can't spread them all over the desk, right? In a living room or home theater, it's the opposite. In this case, PChifi is the most troublesome, as there's no place for the keyboard and mouse.

Regarding sound quality, CD, PChifi, and network streaming can all be excellent. Even if CD is universally acknowledged as the highest upper limit, most stable, and easiest to produce good sound, it doesn't matter. Look at the size of the ESOTERIC K1X. Can you put it next to your computer desk? Moreover, this thing weighs over 30 kilograms, requiring a sturdy table or equipment rack. If an audio device is underutilized due to inconvenience, it doesn't suit you, even if it can reach Hi-End levels.

![22](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/22.jpg>)  
Excellent CD/SACD players still in production are generally large, heavy, and expensive.

## CD

CD is the least to discuss. It's very stable, with minimal tinkering needed. Just buy the machine and then the discs. I played with it for a while but gave up because the CD transport I liked was a bit expensive, and the cheaper ones felt inadequate, not matching my DAC. So, I stopped tinkering.

Two suggestions regarding CD players:

1. Buy a better CD player. The simpler the system, the more demanding it is on the quality of individual components. Moreover, personal modifications to CD players are minimal unless it's a large separate CD player.
2. Don't act impulsively. If you don't have many discs, buying a CD player will lead to staring at it. Experienced players know — hardware is just the beginning. In the later stages, the total cost of CDs often exceeds that of the CD player.

## PChifi

The basic setup is — a computer x1, an all-in-one machine x1, or a DAC and headphone amp combo x1. This is the lowest threshold and the most popular mainstream playstyle.

It's simple and convenient but has many areas to tinker with, including some things seen as "magic" by half-baked electroacoustic enthusiasts. For example — digital signal isolation technology, widely used in USB interfaces and DACs. Some manufacturers have made it into standalone USB isolators, causing uninformed novices to be amazed (here's a keyword, ADI ADuM4165, a new chip released in 2022, supporting USB 2.0 480Mbps specifications).

![23](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/23.jpg>)  
Practice is the only criterion for testing truth. Try it first.

![24](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/24.jpg>)  
TOPPING's USB isolator is very small, affordable, and has low power consumption.

According to some "old audiophiles," PChifi has issues with interference, difficulty in optimization, and low upper limits. I don't know about the first two issues, but "low upper limits" is nonsense. High-performance interfaces and DACs are abundant. As long as the budget is sufficient, how can the upper limit be low? The real shortcoming is — the quality of music files varies. But with the development of various streaming media and the widespread acceptance of paid memberships, this problem is gradually being solved. Moreover, thanks to the vast user base, manufacturers are highly competitive in hardware products, offering high cost-performance. Typical examples are various compact DAC/headphone amp all-in-one machines, commonly referred to as "small desktop devices," from domestic brands like Aune, Yulong, FiiO, Gustard, TOPPING, and SMSL.

![25](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/25.jpg>)  
Many people buy products based on beliefs rather than performance, which is quite puzzling.

I know the next question will be — which one do you recommend? Can you give a sharp review?

Sure, I can give a sharp review, provided you can understand and grasp the key points. After years of development, digital products have become highly homogeneous. The selling points promoted by manufacturers and review articles include some common features and some completely useless ones.

Common features are generally functional, such as "comprehensive digital input interfaces," with the standard configuration being three — USB, TOSLINK (consumer optical, also written as OPT), and COAX (S/PDIF RCA interface).

![26](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/26.jpg>)  
When it comes to interfaces, everyone is actually similar.

AES interfaces, due to their large size, are generally not supported by compact machines. Some manufacturers then make a fuss about this — "Look, my machine supports AES interfaces, more professional." What's the situation? Does AES mean professionalism? Both COAX and AES transmit digital signals. Although AES is more suitable for long-distance transmission, how many HiFi players use 10-meter-long digital signal cables? Not many, right? In this case, the difference between COAX and AES can be ignored (consumer optical is indeed inferior, with two optical-electrical conversions. Glass optical is excellent but rarely supported. Common brands include emm labs and Playback Design).

Completely useless selling points include technical worship, a typical example being — support for high-bitrate audio files, such as 32bit/768kHz and DSD512.

First, the machine's supported bitrate limit depends on the specifications of the digital interface and DAC chip. Today's mainstream solutions can support up to 32bit/768kHz, thanks to chip manufacturers. Second, professional audio equipment, used for recording and production, still mainly supports 24bit/192kHz. High-bitrate files are often upsampled products (probably don't even know who did the upsampling and how it was done. If you love upsampling so much, why not install an HQPlayer?).

![27](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/27.jpg>)  
Lavry's mastering-grade dual-channel DAC, many professional audio workers may have never seen it, supports up to 24/192.

Finally, there's a concept you should know — Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of digital devices. The calculation formula is: $ENOB=(SINAD-1.76)/6.02$

After calculating, you'll find — no DAC in the world can achieve "true 24bit." 32bit/768kHz is just a format support. Therefore, I can conclude — blindly pursuing 32bit/768kHz, DSD512, and other high-bitrate formats is very foolish. If you must pursue this, there's a way — consider buying an EMM Labs DA2, which supports internal upsampling to DSD1024. New ones cost around $20,000. How about getting one?

![28](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/28.jpg>)  
EMM Labs, a brand created by a DSD expert, full of technology and faith. The only problem — many high-bitrate/upsampling enthusiasts can't afford it.

What is a "sharp review"? This is a "sharp review." Its core is — helping you demystify certain things, not just scolding unscrupulous merchants to appear fair and just. As for specific products, I've discussed them in recent years, like TOPPING DX9 and FiiO K19, both excellent new products. The review links are below; feel free to check them out.

[_Scientific Machines and Unscientific HiFi — A Discussion on TOPPING DX9 DAC/Headphone Amp All-in-One Machine_](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv27458521)

[_FiiO FiiO K19 Flagship DAC/Headphone Amp All-in-One Machine Non-Professional Review (Including Cloud Listening with ZMF Caldera)_](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1o142117Fs)

Actually, I don't need to say much. Any all-in-one machine daring to sell for thousands has some strengths. Entry-level players often look at compact machines priced at one to two thousand. Their core is — how to meet as many needs as possible with small size and low cost.

The interfaces should be comprehensive, right? The decoding level shouldn't be poor, right? The headphone amp output power should be sufficient, right? It must be better than portable devices at the same price. Popular models like Aune X1s GT, FiiO K7, Hifiman EF400, and TOPPING DX5 (sorted by initial letter) can all meet these requirements. The only exception is Yulong Canary II, which only has single-ended headphone output and hasn't kept up with the times.

Here, I need to explain. It's not that balanced headphone drive is superior. Balanced drive has two characteristics — slightly higher output impedance and significantly higher channel separation. Since planar magnetic headphones don't have wound voice coils, they are not sensitive to output impedance. Moreover, most machines have low output impedance, which can be ignored. The significant impact is channel separation (i.e., crosstalk). You can hear differences in sound imaging, density, atmosphere, and dynamic performance. Single-ended and balanced outputs have noticeable differences. This is very practical, offering higher playability and compatibility with more headphones. If you like Yulong's tuning style, pay a bit more for Aurora.

I use Aune X1s GT, a machine with a long history, now in its eighth generation. Aune's technical features are different from many manufacturers — focusing on digital clocks and preferring discrete transistors for headphone amps (their USB dongles use discrete transistors for the headphone amp part). It's something that requires both software and hardware to be played well.

The Bluetooth version has an additional antenna socket on the back.

For example, the clock. The performance of the DAC is significantly influenced by the clock. "Is the sound background black?" "Are there details, especially low-frequency details?" are all related to the clock. Nowadays, femtosecond clocks are very common. AccuSilicon is very competitive, making high-performance oscillators cheaper. But it's not just about spending money; you need to know how to use it. How to use it? X1s GT's method is — digital phase-locked loop, controlled by MCU, sent to the USB interface, DAC chip, and other parts. This is not something everyone can do. Why doesn't Hifiman talk about digital clocks in EF400? Doesn't Hifiman know the importance of clocks?

Aune also has a Hi-End brand, Titans. Most of the released products are digital signal-related.

Discrete transistor headphone amps don't have a high technical threshold but take up space (Canary II doesn't have balanced headphone output, possibly due to space constraints). X1s GT's internal structure is two stacked circuit boards, solving this problem. Why use discrete transistors? Two reasons — large headphone amps for power, with good heat dissipation, and small machines for sound quality, providing a comfortable listening experience. The recent trend of discrete transistor op-amps is for similar reasons. Although the parameters don't look as extreme, the listening experience is different.

![33](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/33.jpg>)  
Discrete op-amps come in various packages. Burson uses DIP-8 specifications.

Accuphase's preamp. If you understand circuits, you can see it's also using discrete op-amps.

We can try a live recording of classical chamber music. Since it's a live recording, it should sound deep, lively, immersive, and not boring. The so-called "digital sound" is the opposite of these traits. Listening to music feels like looking at a photo, just a flat surface. With headphones, the sound image moves back and forth inside your head. No wonder it becomes increasingly uncomfortable.

Entry-level scientific machines tend to have this problem — a very dull and boring feeling, lacking musicality, and everything sounds the same. Some say this is "authentic." Well, D90 III, DX9, K19 are also very scientific, right? They don't sound like that. Of course, on the path of mediocrity, there's always a bigger fish. The "muddy" style of EF400 is even more lethal, with a warm and muddy R2R chip paired with a violently outputting headphone amp. Confirmed, it's the "magic tool" that can send me away after prolonged listening.

## Network Streamers

Network streamers are often abbreviated as "streamers," with the full name being "network audio streamers." Compared to PChifi, the hardware differences are minimal, both using DACs as the core of the audio source. Which one to choose depends on your usage scenario. Streamers can be remotely controlled using a phone or tablet, making them a great choice for living rooms, bedrooms, and home theaters where using a computer is inconvenient. They also solve two issues that PChifi users find annoying — 1. Internal interference in computers, making optimization difficult. 2. Noise from fans and mechanical hard drives in computers, which is bothersome. In this light, streamers are indeed a good thing.

Silent Angel M1T V2 version, with internal modifications but the same appearance.

Streamer systems consist of three parts — media server, media renderer, and controller.

Using Roon software, a streamer system is more complex, consisting of four parts — Roon Core, Roon Server, Roon Bridge, and Roon Remote. The latter three correspond one-to-one, with an additional Roon Core for installing the software.

It looks a bit confusing, but don't worry. Today, I'll help you sort out what exactly is going on.

### Media Server / Roon Server

The function of a media server is to store and send music files. Common choices include three types: 1. Network servers, where you buy an account. For a better experience, choose a streaming service that cooperates with hardware manufacturers, such as Silent Angel, which has partnered with QQ Music to launch "Silent Angel Supreme." 2. Local servers, which can be NAS in a local network or hard drives installed in the streamer machine. 3. Home computers serving as servers. I use this method — Foobar2000 software + UPnP plugin. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Install Foobar2000 software, either English or Chinese version.
2. Download the foo_upnp plugin and install it in Foobar2000.
3. Open Foobar2000, click "File" - "Tools" - "UPnP" - "Server" to enable the media server.
4. Enable the UPnP function in the mobile app of the streamer control and select the Foobar2000 server to see the audio files in the playlist.  
   (During use, the computer cannot be turned off. If you don't like Foobar2000, you can use JRiver. Considering the large number of cyber illiterates, I still recommend the free and Chinese-supported Foobar2000. This method is also compatible with PChifi, just by installing an additional plugin.)

This picture should be understandable, right? Follow the instructions above to operate.

### Media Renderer / Roon Bridge

Most sold streamer machines fall into this category. They act as the "bridge" for information transmission, receiving music files from the server on one end and sending digital signals to the DAC through USB, coaxial, etc.

Actual products can be divided into two types:

1. **Pure streamers**, commonly known as "streamer transports" or "network bridges." Manufacturers usually support data storage for user convenience, either built-in or external hard drives. They only output digital signals and require a separate DAC. Examples include dCS Network Bridge and Silent Angel M1T.
2. **Streamer + DAC (and headphone amp)**, which are DACs and all-in-one machines with streaming capabilities, such as Matrix Audio X-SABRE3 and dCS Bartok.

The back panel of the V2 version differs from the first generation. The software can control the switch between USB and digital interfaces.

Bartok's built-in headphone amp is good for dynamic headphones but lacks power for planar magnetic headphones.

There is no superiority between these two types of products. I currently use Lynx Hilo and FiiO K19 on my desk, both without streaming capabilities, so I pair them with Silent Angel M1T to form a system. Starting from scratch, a streamer DAC or all-in-one machine is more convenient. The only thing to note is that streamers depend not only on hardware but also on software. In this regard, Silent Angel and Matrix Audio perform well. For foreign brands, Linn has the most experience, but they only offer all-in-one machines (adding streaming capabilities to old DACs is not as difficult as many think. Engineered and other suppliers offer retail streaming cards, used by CH Precision, but without software support, they are not user-friendly).

![44](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/44.jpg>)  
Engineered, one of the well-known streaming solution providers, also offers DAC design and manufacturing services.

### Controller / Roon Remote

The "remote control" in a streamer system, responsible for machine parameter settings, signal flow control, media library song selection, and other functions. It is usually a phone or tablet with the Roon Remote app or the manufacturer's app. I use Silent Angel M1T, and its dedicated software is called VitOS Orbiter. It can directly connect to QQ Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and other network servers. If you don't know how to use it, the official website provides detailed user manuals.

![45](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/45.jpg>)  
The value of streamers is partly reflected in the software.

Local servers are slightly more complicated, using the UPnP/DLNA network protocol, sometimes requiring third-party apps. Silent Angel recommends BubbleUPnP and mconnect. Additionally, Technics Music App, Linn Kazoo, and other brands' apps can also be tried. It's quite fun; other brands' apps can also be used? Yes, it is not uncommon for "MPD cores to be the same, only the shell is different." Moode and Volumio systems are mainstream in Linux-based streamers, so compatibility is not surprising.

### Finally — What is Roon Core?

Using Roon software, a streamer system has a special requirement — a hardware device to install the Roon software, called "Roon Core."

Common options include three types: 1. NAS with Roon software installed; 2. Home computer with Roon software installed; 3. Dedicated Roon Core devices, such as Roon Nucleus series and Silent Angel Z1. Essentially, they are "mini computers optimized for low power consumption."

These dedicated devices are very convenient to use, with built-in storage for music files, serving as local servers, and USB audio output to connect to DACs. In other words, although called "Roon Core devices," they actually serve as Server, Core, and Bridge.

Many people find streamers difficult to use, unstable, and inconvenient, mainly due to software issues.

Three reasons — 1. The manufacturer's software is poorly made or not provided at all, with no user manual. 2. Users have poor learning ability and might be English illiterates. 3. Many reviews discussing streamers are unclear, immediately suggesting buying a Roon or setting up a NAS. Well, before even listening, you've spent thousands. No wonder the threshold is high.

The first two issues are easily solved by choosing a responsible manufacturer and a user-friendly device. If you don't know how to use it, learn more. If domestic sources are unclear, check foreign tutorials. My method of using "computer + Foobar2000 + UPnP plugin as a server" was learned from others.

Roon is another matter. Although "machines passed Roon Ready certification" is a selling point for many products, we must understand — streamers don't necessarily need Roon. For example, Aurender is not keen on supporting Roon. Why? Because their software is good enough, why pay Roon? This reasoning is sound, right?

In my understanding, Roon's only value is for those streamer DACs and all-in-one machines with Roon Ready certification but no original software. If playing with "pure streamers," it's better to find a user-friendly one. I can't trust a company that doesn't care about software to make good hardware.

![46](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/46.jpg>)  
Silent Angel emphasizes electromagnetic shielding, using a steel chassis instead of common aluminum alloy.

After all this talk, I haven't discussed the sound. Unfortunately, Silent Angel M1T is a pure streamer, only outputting digital signals, and the sound differences of digital signals are too abstract a topic. In this case, common topics like bandwidth, soundstage, and dynamics are meaningless. The popular saying is to judge by "whether the sound background is black," but I have a different view. I believe the main difference in digital sources is — the overall sound style.

Silent Angel M1T has a very natural style, with excellent quality, everything you need, delicate and refined, but not overly tight, similar to WEISS INT204 (my favorite USB interface). It's not picky about DACs and doesn't become a bottleneck. The software is also very user-friendly.

Different styles of digital sources, I'll mention three common among players: 1. Hydra Z, with a relaxed and flavorful sound but also muddy, not reaching mainstream quality, typical of hufi sound. 2. Berkeley Audio Design's Alpha USB, with a powerful, grand sound, not lacking in quality but with more noticeable coloration and high recognition. 3. Prismsound ADA-8XR's digital output, which has a "tight" sound, initially seeming higher quality but tiring and unnatural over time. It has a certain level but is not my preferred style.

![47](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/47.jpg>)  
This is the old version; the new version supports digital volume control, which is not very useful.

The housing is very simple, but the sound is excellent.

See the digital isolation chips? I'm curious, how do some people manage to be both ignorant and confident?

![53](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/53.jpg>)  
I didn't take photos while playing with 8XR, so let's make do with APOGEE, which has a similar style.

## Headphone Amplifiers

The definition and general situation of headphone amplifiers have already been introduced in the first chapter — "low-gain, small-power" line amplifiers. Early designs were very simple, largely due to the popularity of high-impedance headphones at the time. High impedance means "light load." According to Ohm's law, the HD600 with 300 ohms impedance, at 1W output power, requires 17.32V voltage and 57.74mA current. Devices capable of outputting 17.32V voltage are few, but 57.74mA current is very easy, even for a new USB dongle. So, does this mean high-impedance headphones are very "easy to drive" and produce good sound?

![55](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/55.jpg>)  
High impedance = relatively light load. This concept must be understood.

**Unfortunately, it's not that simple.**  
The impedance of dynamic headphones is not constant. The nominal impedance is the test result at 1kHz frequency. The impedance varies greatly at different frequencies, with a resonance peak in the low frequency, where the impedance reaches its maximum. HD600's resonance peak is in the 80-90Hz range, with a peak impedance of 500 ohms (you can check inner fidelity's test results). At this point, achieving 1W output power requires 22.36V voltage and 44.72mA current, and the headphone amp outputs AC signals, with 22.36V voltage being the RMS value. Converting to peak value (x2.828) is 63.23V, meaning the headphone amp's power supply must be at least 70V (circuit components have voltage drops, and large headphone amps and power amps don't have "rail-to-rail" outputs).

A 70V power supply for a headphone amp? Sounds ridiculous. The result of not achieving this is simple — the resonance peak is in the 80-90Hz range, the output voltage is insufficient, the sound pressure is insufficient, and the low-frequency performance naturally suffers. Can you do without a headphone amp?

Hey, aren't these dynamic headphones? Our topic is planar magnetic headphones, with stable impedance and low impedance, so they don't demand much from the front end, right?

This is correct. "Stable impedance of planar magnetic headphones" is a significant advantage. However, they are low impedance, meaning "heavy load," not eating voltage but current. Moreover, planar magnetic headphones have relatively low sensitivity, and the relationship between driving power and sound pressure is non-linear — doubling the driving power only increases the output sound pressure by 3dB.

This is awkward, right? So, do you still need a headphone amp?

Yes, as long as you are not a complete electroacoustic illiterate and have some logical thinking ability, you will find — "playing headphones well" requires a headphone amp. I currently use Burson Soloist Voyager and Aune S17 Pro, both discrete transistor devices with high current and Class A operation, conforming to electroacoustic science principles, with high versatility and plenty of brain burn.

![56](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/56.jpg>)

![59](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/59.jpg>)

Some friends might ask — are tube headphone amps more brain-burning?

Do you remember the "impedance" I just mentioned? Most high-power tube headphone amps use transformer-coupled outputs, inevitably involving "impedance matching" issues — a certain "turns ratio" corresponds to an optimal load impedance. But headphone impedances vary greatly, ranging from 8 ohms to 600 ohms, so which specification to use?

Signal transformers map the secondary load to the primary impedance. This concept is not easy to understand. Simply put, referring to Lundahl LL2774 headphone output transformer's datasheet, it has only three optimal matching impedances. So, my view on "tube headphone amps" is — very brain-burning but not highly versatile. Moreover, direct heating tubes like the 300B used in headphone amps often have signal-to-noise ratio issues, so it's best to test whether you can tolerate them (planar magnetic headphones are generally fine, but dynamic headphones often reveal background noise).

![60](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/60.jpg>)  
Tube headphone amps are well-suited for electrostatic headphones.

Another question might be — why insist on discrete transistors? Aren't integrated chips good enough?

Integrated chip solutions have limitations. Let's first look at their advantages — low power consumption, small size, high efficiency, and easy application. Think about the opposite of these traits. High-impedance headphones require high voltage output, which integrated chips can't achieve. Low-impedance headphones require high current, which integrated chips can't provide. The chip's voltage tolerance, power consumption, and heat dissipation are all limiting factors. "Easy application" lowers the design threshold but also restricts the designer's flexibility. For example, the output impedance of a headphone amp, or the damping factor when pairing with headphones, is determined by the output impedance. Integrated chip solutions can't achieve ultra-low impedance, typically above 1 ohm, while discrete transistor headphone amps can achieve 0.1 ohms, a difference of an order of magnitude.

Note, I'm not saying "higher voltage and current always result in better sound" or "headphone amps must have ultra-low output impedance to sound good." But these represent "design possibilities," a question of "whether it can be achieved." On the path to high performance, this is crucial.

![61](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/61.jpg>)  
Discrete transistor designs are very scientific. If they don't perform well, it's the manufacturer's fault.

I'll discuss the sound part in the next article, along with headphone pairings. Today, I'll use internal pictures of the Burson Soloist Voyager to explain how discrete transistor Class A headphone amps are made, what's inside, and where the technological advancements lie.

The Voyager uses a dual mono structure, with left and right mirror layouts. The signal flow is divided into three parts — input stage, volume control, and output stage.

![62](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/62.jpg>)

The input stage functions as pre-gain, signal conversion, and low-impedance output. The Voyager supports both RCA and XLR interfaces, which transmit different signals. RCA is a single-ended signal, while XLR is a balanced differential signal, requiring unified processing. The Voyager is a balanced headphone amp, so it converts single-ended signals into balanced signals, with subsequent processes further amplifying the balanced signals.

![63](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/63.jpg>)  
The picture shows different discrete op-amps. In actual use, the left and right channels need to be consistent.

Volume control is the soul of a headphone amp. If you still think using an RK50 or DACT potentiometer is amazing, it only shows your understanding is outdated. These "no-threshold, purchasable" components aren't considered high-level. The cost isn't the issue; the price doubles when resold, and the player bears it.

Traditional potentiometers have two problems — "low precision and non-constant input/output impedance." The alternatives are — "relay + resistor" and "volume control chip." The Voyager uses the MUSES72320 chip (one for each channel, also chosen by many famous machines). Its performance partly depends on external op-amps, so Burson uses its discrete op-amps. The entire machine uses 6 discrete op-amps for the left and right channels' input stage and volume control. If you want to tinker, start with the volume control part for more noticeable effects.

![64](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/64.jpg>)  
Silicone rings are used to fix the op-amps and prevent them from falling out.

![65](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/65.jpg>)  
The red housing is the V7 Vivid version.

![66](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/66.jpg>)  
When playing with discrete op-amps, be sure to check the pin configuration. Inserting them incorrectly will burn them.

The output stage consists of four sets of discrete transistor modules. You can think of them as — the Plus version of discrete op-amps. They have more complex circuit structures, higher operating voltages, larger output currents, higher power consumption, and larger components to handle these.

The Voyager uses 8 TO-220F packaged medium-power transistors for output, operating in Class A. There are two ways to explain this concept — 1. The conduction angle of the output transistor in one sine wave cycle. 2. The static bias current of the output transistor.

The former is a professional explanation. A sine wave cycle is 360 degrees. If the output transistor's conduction angle is 360 degrees, it's Class A. If it's 180 degrees, it's Class B. If it's between 180 and 360 degrees, it's Class AB. The latter is a common explanation — if the static current exceeds the rated output current, it's Class A. The Voyager's rated power is "32-ohm load, balanced output, 8W power." Converting this, if the static current exceeds 500mA, it's Class A (hence, Class A amps are very hot. The Voyager's heat sink is located at the bottom of the chassis).

What are the benefits of Class A amplifiers? The most basic — it solves the "crossover distortion" problem. Additionally, it effectively handles the "impedance fluctuation" problem of headphones.

As for the common belief that "Class A amplifiers have sweet, warm, and thick sound," that's a misconception. Discrete transistors and Class A operation don't necessarily determine the sound style. The Burson Soloist Voyager and Aune S17 Pro are both modern-style machines. The former is full and grand, while the latter is open and delicate, neither being "warm and muddy." Don't judge all machines by DIY Hood1969 or PASS small headphone amps. They are neither from the same era nor the same level of design.

The above introduces the signal amplification part. One-third of the Voyager's internal space is the power supply, as the static current and rated power are very high, requiring a robust power supply.

![67](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/67.jpg>)

The traditional design is like the Aune S17 Pro, with a high-power transformer and large-capacity filter capacitors, which are straightforward and easy to understand. Burson's concept is more innovative, choosing a 170kHz frequency, square wave mode DC-DC power supply, called the "MCPS" solution. They believe this design — has lower power supply impedance and pushes noise beyond the human audible range (above the 20kHz hearing limit, so humans can't hear it).

Which one has more brain burn? It's hard to say, as each has its own theory. Different solutions to the same problem. Hi-End power amps also use switching power supplies, such as Soulution Audio. For small signal parts, Burson uses a traditional solution — ADI's high-performance LDO chip, known as the Silent Power Module inside the machine.

![68](<../../assets/Popular%20Science%20and%20Miscellaneous%20Talks%20on%20Planar%20Magnetic%20Headphones%20(Part%202)/68.jpg>)  
I heard older machines can be upgraded to the new version's voltage regulator module.

Headphone amps best reflect the manufacturer's skill and artistic taste. There's no set formula, following the times, but high-tech influence is limited. It's more about "accumulating and applying experience." With the development of information, today we can DIY a headphone amp at a low cost. Regardless of sound quality, basic functions are no problem (decoding chips won't work if not used correctly). This gives many people the illusion — buying a headphone amp is a loss. Actually, if you can understand the following teardown pictures, you'll realize — there's no alien technology inside Hi-End power amps.

D'Agostino's pure power amp, the input stage module is common with many of their other models.

Once the audio source reaches a certain level, the differences are subtle. Amplifiers vary, with technical parameters being basic. More importantly, they meet "subjective needs" and "the sound we want," leading to many tricks incomprehensible to outsiders, sometimes seen as "mysticism" or "unnecessary." But just listening will make it clear. You can say "what we pursue doesn't align with HiFi's original intent," but the mental comparison of analog parameters will never tell you what "good sound" is.

Vinyl systems' parameters are unreliable, but the sound isn't bad, very counterintuitive. Try it if you have the chance; can you accept it? If yes, then you won't need to worry about parameters anymore.

TOPPING's machines have excellent parameters, but the sound is different. Guessing based on parameters solves nothing.

# Conclusion

Before I knew it, this article reached over 10,000 words. HiFi popular science is a laborious task, requiring "theory to guide practice." First, clarify basic concepts and common classifications, then "practice to verify theory," providing practical methods, and explaining what you're spending money on with actual items.

In the third article of this series, I'll discuss specific models, personal listening impressions, and system pairings. Many people love this part. What's the use of theory? Isn't it just about buying headphones? The level you aim to reach determines the answer, but understanding it better is always beneficial.
